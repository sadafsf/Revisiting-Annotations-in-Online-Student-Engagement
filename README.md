## Description of Annotations
This repository contains two CSV files with the re-annotations of the DAiSEE dataset, employing the Human Expert Labeling Protocol (HELP). These annotations provide a more nuanced understanding of learner engagement, incorporating emotional, behavioral, and engagement scales.

The annotations follow the numeric conventions of the HELP protocol, which classifies behavioral and emotional states, as well as engagement levels, using the following scheme:
## Annotation Categories

| Category      | Value | State       |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Behavioral    | `0`   | Off-Task    |
|               | `1`   | On-Task     |
| Emotional     | `0`   | Bored       |
|               | `1`   | Calm        |
|               | `2`   | Confused    |
|               | `3`   | Excited     |
| Engagement    | `0`   | Not Engaged |
|               | `1`   | Engaged     |
